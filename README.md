Section 3 – Low-Code / AI Automation

To automate the flow (Homepage → Work → Contact form) using a low-code or AI-powered automation tool such as Testim, Mabl, or Katalon, the steps would generally be as follows:

1. **Create a New Test Project:**  
   Start by creating a new test project or test case within the chosen low-code automation platform.

2. **Record the Automation Flow:**  
   Use the built-in test recorder or UI interaction capture feature to record the user journey:
   - Open the application homepage URL.
   - Verify that the homepage loaded (some tools allow adding assertions on page title or elements).
   - Click on the "Work" menu item in the header.
   - Confirm that the "Our Work" text or section appears on the loaded page.
   - Navigate to the Contact page via menu or link.
   - Fill in the form fields (Name, Email, Message) with the sample data.
   - Optionally include assertions to verify that the inputs have been entered correctly.

3. **Enhance the Test with AI Suggestions:**  
   Some platforms provide AI-powered enhancements such as auto-healing selectors, test stability recommendations, or intelligent waits for dynamic elements. Incorporate these suggestions to improve test robustness.

4. **Set Up Test Parameters:**  
   Define any input data parameters (if supported), allowing the test to run with different sets of data without editing the test script manually.

5. **Run and Debug the Test:**  
   Execute the recorded test within the tool’s environment and verify its pass/fail status. Review logs and screenshots if available to debug any failures.

6. **Schedule and Integrate:**  
   Schedule test execution on-demand or at specific intervals. Integrate the test runs with CI/CD pipelines or other development workflows for continuous validation.

7. **Review and Maintain:**  
   Use the low-code tool’s dashboard or AI insights to monitor test health, update selectors when UI changes occur, and maintain the test suite effortlessly as the application evolves.

This step-by-step approach leverages low-code/AI automation tool features to efficiently build and maintain UI test automation with less manual scripting and more visual interaction and AI-assisted intelligence.To automate the flow (Homepage → Work → Contact form) using a low-code or AI-powered tool like Testim, Mabl, or Katalon, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project or test case in the automation tool.
2. Use the tool’s recorder to capture the user journey:
   - Open the homepage URL.
   - Verify the page title or a key homepage element.
   - Click the “Work” menu item and verify the “Our Work” content.
   - Navigate to the Contact page.
   - Fill in the Name, Email, and Message fields with sample data.
   - Optionally verify that these inputs were correctly filled.
3. Enhance the test using AI features like auto-healing locators or timeout optimizations to improve robustness.
4. Parameterize input data if supported, for easier test data variation.
5. Run, debug, and validate the test execution results within the platform.
6. Schedule tests for automated runs and integrate with CI/CD pipelines if needed.
7. Maintain tests effortlessly using AI-driven suggestions for updates after UI changes.






Section 4 – AI in QA

AI will greatly improve software testing in the next three years by making it faster, more accurate, and covering more aspects of testing. It can create and adjust test cases automatically as applications change, which saves time on manual updates. AI can also detect unreliable tests and focus on the most important ones based on previous issues.

With natural language processing, even non-technical team members can describe what they want to test, making it easier for everyone to contribute. AI analytics will help teams understand quality trends and spot potential problem areas, allowing them to concentrate their testing where it’s needed most.

In summary, AI will help teams release software faster and with better quality by automating difficult tests, reducing mistakes, and continuously improving the testing process. This shift will make quality assurance more proactive and integrated into the development process, benefiting business agility and customer satisfaction.
